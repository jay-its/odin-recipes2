    <img src="/images/lasagna-unsplash.jpg" height="200" alt="A picture of yummy lasagna" title="Clearly not my mommas lasagna">
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This lasagne doesn’t just sit quietly on your plate – it’s ready to let loose! With layers that party in your mouth, each 
        bite is a cheesy, saucy celebration of carbs and questionable life choices. Perfect for those nights when you want to eat 
        like it’s a holiday but feel like it’s a Tuesday.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li> <strong>5 layers</strong> of <em>"Can't Believe It's Not Homemade"</em> pasta sheets</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> of <em>"Cheese with No Regrets"</em></li>
        <li><strong>1 jar</strong> of <em>"One-Too-Many"</em> marinara sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> of <em>"Extra Lazy"</em> ground beef substitute</li>
        <li><strong>A pinch</strong> of <em>"Forgot-the-Salt"</em> seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F, and then <em>immediately</em> forget why you walked
            into the kitchen.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the pasta sheets while debating if this was a good idea. (Spoiler: it was.)</li>
        <li>Layer the ingredients with reckless abandon, not necessarily in order.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the aroma convinces you it’s finally dinnertime.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for approximately 5 minutes, or just burn your mouth in excitement. Your call.</li>
    </ol>
