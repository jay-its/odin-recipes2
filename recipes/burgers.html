    <img src="/images/burgers-unsplash.jpg" height="200" alt="A photo of yummy burgers" title="Clearly not a real photo of my burgers.">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This burger’s not here to mess around. It’s here to butter you up in all the right ways, with layers of juicy flavor that’ll 
        make you forget about that diet you started yesterday. Each bite is a buttery, beefy ode to indulgence.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li><strong>2</strong> "Thick and Proud" burger patties</li>
        <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> of "Way Too Much" butter</li>
        <li><strong>1 slice</strong> of "I Deserve This" cheddar</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> "Fluffy but Firm" brioche buns</li>
        <li><strong>A drizzle</strong> of "Feeling Fancy" truffle oil (optional, but highly encouraged)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan, realizing halfway through you <em>might’ve used too much.</em></li>
        <li>Grill the burger patties in the butter, because <em>why stop now?</em></li>
        <li>Add cheddar cheese on top and let it melt like your <em>willpower</em>.</li>
        <li>Toast the brioche buns until they’re golden, pretending you <em>didn’t</em> just butter those too.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burger, drizzle with truffle oil, and enjoy while congratulating yourself for <em>being this extra.</em></li>
    </ol>
