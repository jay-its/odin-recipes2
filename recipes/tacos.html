    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You’re about to taste something so good, it’ll have you questioning everything, including why Bruce 
            Willis isn't in more taco commercials. This taco is here to fill your action-packed cravings with 
            flavor explosions in every bite.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3</strong> soft or hard “Is This a Burrito?” tortillas</li>
        <li><strong>1 pound</strong> of "Willis-Worthy" ground beef</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> of "Tear-Jerker" spicy salsa</li>
        <li><strong>½ cup</strong> of "Yippee-Ki-Yay" guacamole</li>
        <li><strong>A sprinkle</strong> of “Die Hard Cheese”</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the ground beef while watching your favorite Willis movie for <em>inspiration</em>.</li>
        <li>Heat the tortillas and wonder if they’ve always been this soft.</li>
        <li>Assemble the tacos with beef, salsa, and guacamole like you’re defusing a flavor bomb.</li>
        <li>Add cheese while shouting, “Yippee-Ki-Yay!” (This is mandatory.)</li>
        <li>Devour <em>immediately</em>, ensuring at least one taco falls apart in your hands.</li>
    </ol>
